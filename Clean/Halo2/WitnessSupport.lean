# Semantic read support for witness programs

Native callbacks are ordinary functions, so their dependencies cannot be inferred by the
structured IR collector. `WitnessFunctionSupport reads compute` certifies the function
itself: equal immutable context data and equal listed cell values imply equal results. It
composes through arbitrary deterministic arithmetic on those results. The rules tagged
`witness_support` cover the program shapes Clean itself produces; a downstream project tags
the rules for its own callbacks.

/-! ## Supported parameters

A gadget that takes a witness program or a native function as a parameter cannot discharge
its read obligation for an arbitrary value of that parameter. So it takes the parameter in one
of the two forms below, which carry a certified read set. Its contract then declares the
parameter's reads, and the registration tactic closes the obligation from the certificate,
since the `support` fields are themselves rules. -/

/-- A witness program with a certified read set. -/

  /-- The program. -/
  program : WitgenIR F 1
  /-- The cells that the program may read. -/
  reads : List (AssignedCell F)
  /-- The certificate that the program reads only those cells. -/
  support : WitnessFunctionSupport reads (fun env => (program.eval env)[0])

  /-- The cells that the function may read. -/

  /-- The certificate that the function reads only those cells. -/
  support : WitnessFunctionSupport reads compute

/-- A function of the assignment with a certified read set: the form of a parameter that a
witness program lifts to the prover environment and that `extract` applies to the assignment
itself, so the certificate is about the lift. -/
